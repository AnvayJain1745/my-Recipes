STEP_BY_STEP PROCESS TO BAKE A CAKE
Preheat your oven to 180 degrees.
In a bowl, add yogurt and add baking soda. Let it sit for 5-10 minutes after mixing and let it foam up.
Combine oil and sugar and mix well.
Add in the yogurt mixture and then add the vanilla. Mix well to incorporate air.
Sift in maida and baking powder. Do not skip sieving here and do not over-mix. Mix only until no flour pockets remain.
Break 16 cookies into desirable size and mix into the batter.
Using an ice-cream scooper, pour into muffin liners.
Bake at 180 for 25-30 minutes.
For the buttercream, take oreo cookies and grind them very well.
Beat one cup of butter at high speed and also add in the vanilla. Mix in the cream of the oreo cookies.
Once well combined, add in the sugar and mix well. Add in the ground oreo cookies. Mix until the frosting has come together and is fluffy.
Pipe over cooled cupcakes in any desirable manner!
